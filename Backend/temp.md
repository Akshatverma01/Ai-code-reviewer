❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` doesn't declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will likely lead to an error (e.g.,
`ReferenceError: a is not defined`) when the function is executed or produce `NaN` if `a` and `b` happen to exist in the
global scope but are undefined.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, limiting its reusability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making the function more flexible and reusable.
* ✔ No longer relies on variables from an outer scope (global or otherwise), making the function more predictable and
less prone to unexpected behavior.

Alternatively (more modern syntax):

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Uses arrow function syntax, which can be more concise.
* ✔ Uses `const` to declare the function, indicating that it should not be reassigned. (This is good practice for
functions that are not intended to be changed.)
